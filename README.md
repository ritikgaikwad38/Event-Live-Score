# Event-Live-Score
In college events we mostly use pen and paper for scoreboard. If that particular paper is lost because of some reasons so our scoreboard is also lost. So we have developed a web application for updating live scores and constructed a website to view Live Scores.  There have been several tries at predicting sport games using data from the past, but humans are still superior at predicting sport outcomes. There are multiple commercial services which have sports analysis and prediction as their main business. They use “sophisticated software and statistical algorithms” to aid their data tracking, but at the core they still have experts analysing the games manually. In the present article, we proposed the system to provide a switch section for the live updated scores of Events. We use the API of Live Score for matches. System shows the live score for all matches. This system is implemented by using php and mysql apache server for client server communication.  This system is designed to minimize the Volunteer effort for maintaining a Scoreboard. As the Updating Scoreboard process is done without any human interference, which is the main scope in the system, the aim is completed.
